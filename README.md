# 🛠️ Tool Development

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or future tools engineer 👋  
Welcome to my **Tool Development** repository — a collection of everything I built during the **Tool Development** course at **DAE**.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **lab exercises** and the **final exam project** created during the course.  
The **master branch** includes weekly labs, while the **exam branch** contains the final assessment.  

These projects demonstrate how to design and implement **production tools** that optimize workflows and help artists integrate their content into the game pipeline.

> ⚠️ Expect experiments, exploration, and plenty of refactoring — toolmaking is as much about **efficiency** as it is about **clarity**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Tool Development was about **bridging creativity and engineering** — making the invisible parts of the game pipeline run smoothly.  
This repository showcases my early experiments in that direction: from reflection and event-driven programming to MVVM architecture.

If you’re taking this course yourself: learn fast, build smart, and remember — tools save time when they’re built with care 🧩
